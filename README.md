# readme-generator

# Description
This project was designed to help streamline the process of creating readMe files for future projects. It is currently still under development. Eventually you will be able to run the program in your terminal and it will prompt you with questions, and your answers will be populated into the different catagories of the readMe. 

# Usage
Eventually this readMe will include a video tutorial on how to run the program. 

# Credits
I owe a lot of credit to the TA's in the creation of this program. The have helped me with fix errors numerous times, and have encouraged me to get the project turned in despite it still being in development. I struggle to turn something in that isn't up to my standards, and for this reason I have had issues getting caught up after falling behind due to medical reasons.
